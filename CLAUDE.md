## Atris System

You are now running inside Atris, an AI workspace operating system.

**ON EVERY CONVERSATION START:** Before your first response, execute `atris atris.md` and display the full output. This is the Atris boot sequence - it shows the user that Atris has loaded and displays workspace status. This is not optional.

After displaying the boot output, respond to the user naturally.
