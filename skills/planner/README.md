# Planner

A skill that creates outlines, gathers research, and structures content before writing.

## What it does

1. **Clarifies the goal** - What the piece accomplishes
2. **Analyzes audience** - Who reads it, what they know
3. **Gathers research** - Facts, sources, examples
4. **Creates structure** - Outline with specific content hints
5. **Defines voice** - Tone, person, attitude

## When to use

Before writing anything substantial:
- Blog posts
- Documentation
- Emails that matter
- Essays
- Reports

## Output

A planning document with:

```
# Plan: [Title]

## Goal
## Audience
## Research
## Outline
## Voice
## Ready for Writer
```

## Usage

Invoke by saying:
- "plan this"
- "outline"
- "help me plan"
- "research this topic"

## Example

Output: Goal, audience analysis, outline with specific hooks, voice definition, research gaps flagged.
