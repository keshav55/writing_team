# Writer

A skill that drafts content with voice, rhythm, and specificity.

## What it does

1. **Follows structure** - Uses the planner's outline
2. **Writes with voice** - Sounds human, has opinions
3. **Stays specific** - Concrete details, real numbers
4. **Varies rhythm** - Mixes sentence lengths
5. **Flags gaps** - Marks missing info instead of making it up

## Core principles

- **Voice over correctness** - Sound like a person
- **Rhythm is structure** - Vary sentence lengths
- **Specificity is credibility** - Details feel real
- **Openings hook** - Don't start with throat-clearing
- **Endings land** - Don't trail off or summarize

## When to use

After planning, before editing:
- Turning outlines into drafts
- Writing first versions
- Getting ideas down

## Output

A complete draft with notes:

```
# [Title]

[Full draft]

---

## Writer Notes
- [Gaps flagged]
- [Questions for copy-editor]
```

## Usage

Invoke by saying:
- "write this"
- "draft this"
- "start writing"

## In the workflow

```
planner → writer → copy-editor
            ✓
```

Planner prepares. Writer writes. Copy-editor reviews.
